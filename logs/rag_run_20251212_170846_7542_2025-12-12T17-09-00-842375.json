    "answer": "Here's a breakdown of how ragas are performed and used within classical music, based on the provided documents:\n\n**How Raga Performance Works:**\n\n* **Instruments:**  Ragas can be performed on instruments like the sitar, sarod, tabla, violin, and others that utilize specific scales (melodic patterns) known as ragas. \n* **Vocals:** Some ragas are specifically sung using a melodic style known for its improvisational elements. This often involves intricate vocal techniques and ornamentation.\n\n**Raga Use in Classical Music:**\n\n* **Emotional Evoking:** The most common way ragas are used is to evoke specific emotions.  Think of how certain notes or musical styles can create feelings of joy, sorrow, hope, etc., just like a language's melody. \n* **Beyond Performance:** Raga structures also serve as a framework for improvisation (creating new melodies and improvisational parts), which adds a level of complexity and artistry to the performance. \n\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nRagas are like musical \"building blocks\" in Indian classical music.  They provide a melodic framework, but their true beauty lies in how they're performed by musicians using specific instruments or voices, allowing them to express a range of emotions through improvisation and creative interpretation.",
